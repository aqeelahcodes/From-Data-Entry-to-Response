# From-Data-Entry-to-Response

## About
Created a visual to show users how online forms work. There are two parts to a working form. First, is the form you see on the page itself that is created using HTML markup. Forms are made up of input fields, buttons, drop-down menus to collect information from users. The other part of a web form is an application or script on the serve that processes the information collected by the form and returns an appropriate response. It's what makes the form work!
